# For this test to run properly, please setup as follows:
# 1. Create a Vectara account: sign up at https://console.vectara.com/signup
# 2. Create a corpus in your Vectara account, with a filter attribute called "test_num".
# 3. Create an API_KEY for this corpus with permissions for query and indexing
# 4. Setup environment variables:
#    VECTARA_API_KEY, VECTARA_CORPUS_ID and VECTARA_CUSTOMER_ID
