> [NVIDIA AI Foundation Endpoints](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/) give users easy access to NVIDIA hosted API endpoints for NVIDIA AI Foundation Models like Mixtral 8x7B, Llama 2, Stable Diffusion, etc. These models, hosted on the [NVIDIA NGC catalog](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/ai-foundation-models), are optimized, tested, and hosted on the NVIDIA AI platform, making them fast and easy to evaluate, further customize, and seamlessly run at peak performance on any accelerated stack.
> 
> With [NVIDIA AI Foundation Endpoints](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/), you can get quick results from a fully accelerated stack running on [NVIDIA DGX Cloud](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-cloud/). Once customized, these models can be deployed anywhere with enterprise-grade security, stability, and support using [NVIDIA AI Enterprise](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/).
> 
> These models can be easily accessed via the [`langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints`](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints/) package, as shown below.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints
```

## Setup and Authentication

- Create a free [NVIDIA NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/) account.
- Navigate to `Catalog > AI Foundation Models > (Model with API endpoint)`.
- Select `API` and generate the key `NVIDIA_API_KEY`.

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

```python
from langchain_nvidia_ai_endpoints import ChatNVIDIA

llm = ChatNVIDIA(model="mixtral_8x7b")
result = llm.invoke("Write a ballad about LangChain.")
print(result.content)
```

## Using NVIDIA AI Foundation Endpoints

A selection of NVIDIA AI Foundation models are supported directly in LangChain with familiar APIs.

The active models which are supported can be found [in NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/ai-foundation-models).
