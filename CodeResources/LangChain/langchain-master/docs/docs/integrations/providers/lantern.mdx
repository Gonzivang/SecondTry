# Lantern

This page covers how to use the [Lantern](https://github.com/lanterndata/lantern) within LangChain
It is broken into two parts: setup, and then references to specific Lantern wrappers.

## Setup
1. The first step is to create a database with the `lantern` extension installed.

    Follow the steps at [Lantern Installation Guide](https://github.com/lanterndata/lantern#-quick-install) to install the database and the extension. The docker image is the easiest way to get started.

## Wrappers

### VectorStore

There exists a wrapper around Postgres vector databases, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:
```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Lantern
```

### Usage

For a more detailed walkthrough of the Lantern Wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/lantern)
