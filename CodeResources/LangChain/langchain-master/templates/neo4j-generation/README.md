# neo4j-generation

This template pairs LLM-based knowledge graph extraction with Neo4j AuraDB, a fully managed cloud graph database.

You can create a free instance on [Neo4j Aura](https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database?utm_source=langchain&utm_content=langserve).

When you initiate a free database instance, you'll receive credentials to access the database.

This template is flexible and allows users to guide the extraction process by specifying a list of node labels and relationship types.

For more details on the functionality and capabilities of this package, please refer to [this blog post](https://blog.langchain.dev/constructing-knowledge-graphs-from-text-using-openai-functions/).

## Environment Setup

You need to set the following environment variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
NEO4J_URI=<YOUR_NEO4J_URI>
NEO4J_USERNAME=<YOUR_NEO4J_USERNAME>
NEO4J_PASSWORD=<YOUR_NEO4J_PASSWORD>
```

## Usage

To use this package, you should first have the LangChain CLI installed:

```shell
pip install -U langchain-cli
```

To create a new LangChain project and install this as the only package, you can do:

```shell
langchain app new my-app --package neo4j-generation
```

If you want to add this to an existing project, you can just run:

```shell
langchain app add neo4j-generation
```

And add the following code to your `server.py` file:
```python
from neo4j_generation.chain import chain as neo4j_generation_chain

add_routes(app, neo4j_generation_chain, path="/neo4j-generation")
```

(Optional) Let's now configure LangSmith. 
LangSmith will help us trace, monitor and debug LangChain applications. 
LangSmith is currently in private beta, you can sign up [here](https://smith.langchain.com/). 
If you don't have access, you can skip this section


```shell
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=<your-project>  # if not specified, defaults to "default"
```

If you are inside this directory, then you can spin up a LangServe instance directly by:

```shell
langchain serve
```

This will start the FastAPI app with a server is running locally at 
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

We can see all templates at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
We can access the playground at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/neo4j-generation/playground](http://127.0.0.1:8000/neo4j-generation/playground)  

We can access the template from code with:

```python
from langserve.client import RemoteRunnable

runnable = RemoteRunnable("http://localhost:8000/neo4j-generation")
```
