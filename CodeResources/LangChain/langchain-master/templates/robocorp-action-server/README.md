# Langchain - Robocorp Action Server

This template enables using [Robocorp Action Server](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp) served actions as tools for an Agent.

## Usage

To use this package, you should first have the LangChain CLI installed:

```shell
pip install -U langchain-cli
```

To create a new LangChain project and install this as the only package, you can do:

```shell
langchain app new my-app --package robocorp-action-server
```

If you want to add this to an existing project, you can just run:

```shell
langchain app add robocorp-action-server
```

And add the following code to your `server.py` file:

```python
from robocorp_action_server import agent_executor as action_server_chain

add_routes(app, action_server_chain, path="/robocorp-action-server")
```

### Running the Action Server

To run the Action Server, you need to have the Robocorp Action Server installed

```bash
pip install -U robocorp-action-server
```

Then you can run the Action Server with:

```bash
action-server new
cd ./your-project-name
action-server start
```

### Configure LangSmith (Optional)

LangSmith will help us trace, monitor and debug LangChain applications.
LangSmith is currently in private beta, you can sign up [here](https://smith.langchain.com/).

```shell
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
