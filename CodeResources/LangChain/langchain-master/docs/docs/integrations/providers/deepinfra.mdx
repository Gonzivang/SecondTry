# DeepInfra

This page covers how to use the DeepInfra ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific DeepInfra wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- Get your DeepInfra api key from this link [here](https://deepinfra.com/).
- Get an DeepInfra api key and set it as an environment variable (`DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN`)

## Available Models

DeepInfra provides a range of Open Source LLMs ready for deployment.
You can list supported models for
[text-generation](https://deepinfra.com/models?type=text-generation) and
[embeddings](https://deepinfra.com/models?type=embeddings).
google/flan\* models can be viewed [here](https://deepinfra.com/models?type=text2text-generation).

You can view a [list of request and response parameters](https://deepinfra.com/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf/api).
