Google [announced](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai) their much awaited set of Generative AI APIs, Gemini last week. They have made available their Gemini Pro available via API with the much powerful Gemini Ultra coming later next year. At Promptly, we are excited to announce that we are making Gemini Pro available to our users via our [LLMStack](https://llmstack.ai) framework and [Promptly](https://trypromplty.com) platform.
