# Introducing LLMStack

Excited to introduce LLMStack, an open source, low-code platform to build powerful AI experiences using LLMs.

<!--truncate-->

## Overview

LLMStack is an end to end platform that allows you to build powerful AI applications using LLMs. You can build AI applications that can generate text, answer questions, summarize text, translate text, generate media and more. You can also chain multiple LLMs together to build complex AI applications. You can connect your data to LLMStack and use it to augment the language models. You can also connect your business processes to LLMStack and use it to automate your workflows.

LLMStack comes with everything you need to build AI applications. It comes with a no-code builder that allows you to build AI applications without writing any code. It comes with a vector database that allows you to store your data and use it to augment the language models. Using its powerful API, you can integrate your AI applications with your existing products and services.

## Features

- **üîó Chain multiple models:** LLMStack allows you to chain multiple LLMs together to build complex generative AI applications.

- **üìä Use generative AI on your Data:** Import your data into your accounts and use it in AI chains. LLMStack allows importing various types (_CSV, TXT, PDF, DOCX, PPTX etc.,_) of data from a variety of sources (_gdrive, notion, websites, direct uploads etc.,_). Platform will take care of preprocessing and vectorization of your data and store it in the vector database that is provided out of the box.

- **üõ†Ô∏è No-code builder:** LLMStack comes with a no-code builder that allows you to build AI chains without any coding experience. You can chain multiple LLMs together and connect them to your data and business processes.

- **‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy to the cloud or on-premise:** LLMStack can be deployed to the cloud or on-premise. You can deploy it to your own infrastructure or use our cloud offering at [Promptly](https://trypromptly.com).

- **üöÄ API access:** Apps or chatbots built with LLMStack can be accessed via HTTP API. You can also trigger your AI chains from **_Slack_** or **_Discord_**.

- **üè¢ Multi-tenant:** LLMStack is multi-tenant. You can create multiple organizations and add users to them. Users can only access the data and AI chains that belong to their organization.

## What can you build with LLMStack?

Using LLMStack you can build a variety of generative AI applications, chatbots and agents. Here are some examples:

- **Chatbots:** Build chatbots that can answer questions, generate text, summarize text, translate text, classify text and more.

- **AI Assistants:** Build AI assistants that can automate your workflows and business processes.

- **AI Agents:** Build AI agents that can help you with your day to day tasks.

- **AI Applications:** Build AI applications that can generate text, answer questions, summarize text, translate text, classify text and more.
