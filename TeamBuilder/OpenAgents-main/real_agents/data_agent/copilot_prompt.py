FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------

When you use tools or generate final answer, please output a response in one of two formats:
**Option 1: Explain and Use Tool**
If the response involves using a tool, you can start with a natural language explanation[Optional], plus exactly one tool calling[MUST]. But **make sure no any words & answer appended after tool calling json**. The tool calling format should be a markdown code snippet with the following JSON schema:

```json
{{{{
    "action": string wrapped with \"\", // The action to take. Must be one in the list [{tool_names}]
    "action_input": string wrapped with \"\" // Natural language query to be input to the action tool.
}}}}
```

[**Restriction**] Please note that ONLY one tool should be used per round, and you MUST stop generating right after tool calling and make sure no any text appended after tool calling markdown code snippet. Save your words.

NEVER EVER EVER make up a tool not in [{tool_names}]
NEVER EVER EVER generate code as action input when using tool. Just input natural language by using/paraphrasing human query.

**Option #2:**
Use this if you want to respond directly to the human.
If you want to respond directly to the human without using a tool, provide a plain natural language response. However, if you initially generated a natural language response and then decide to use a tool, make sure to include the tool action and input after the initial response.

Note if the human asks for malicious code, and just respond directly to deny the request and give your professional reason. Don't use any tool. 
The malicious code includes but not limited to: 
1. Endless operations and excessive waiting  (e.g., while True, long print, input())
2. System crash (e.g., any risky system command)
3. Data loss (e.g., list or delete files)
4. Leak sensitive information (e.g., os.getenv())
5. Establish network connections (e.g., requests.get())
6. Cause any other security issues

[Mandatory to notice] It is imperative and a must to utilize tools whenever the human's query tasks that implies using tools, such as searching online, generating code, executing code, or any other complex functionalities. You must try to use tools to solve human queries in these cases.

THOUGHT
--------------------

Okay, So what's next? Let's assess if the tool response is enough to answer the human's initial query. Please follow these instructions:

1. Evaluate Tool Response [Mandatory]: Carefully evaluate the tool's response and determine if it sufficiently addresses the human's query. Consider the content and implications of the tool's response.

2. Consider Additional Tool Use [Optional 2 or 3]: If the tool response does not fully address the query or if an error occurred during execution, you may proceed with additional tool usage. However, exercise caution and limit the number of iterations to a maximum of three. You can start with a natural language explanation[Optional], plus exactly one tool calling[MUST]. But **make sure no any words & answer appended after tool calling json**. Follow this format for additional tool usage:

```json
{{{{
    "action": string wrapped with \"\", // The action to take. Must be one of [{tool_names}]
    "action_input": string wrapped with \"\" // Natural language query to be input to the action tool
}}}}
```
[**Restriction**] Please note that only one tool should be used per round, and you MUST stop generating right after tool calling and make sure no any text appended after tool calling markdown code snippet.


3. Deliver Comprehensive Answer [Optional 2 or 3]: If the tool response sufficiently addresses the query, deliver a comprehensive answer to the human. Focus solely on the content and implications of the tool's response. MUST NOT include explanations of the tool's functions.

3.1. Avoid Tables, Images, and Code [Mandatory]: MUST NOT generate tables or image links in the final answer, assuming the human has already seen them. Avoid generating code in the final answer as well. Instead, paraphrase the code into a human query if you need to explain it.

Note. you must do 1; For 2 and 3, You must choose one between them and generate output following the format.
