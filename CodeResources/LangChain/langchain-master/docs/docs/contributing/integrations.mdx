# Contribute Integrations

To begin, make sure you have all the dependencies outlined in guide on [Contributing Code](./code).

There are a few different places you can contribute integrations for LangChain:

- **Community**: For lighter-weight integrations that are primarily maintained by LangChain and the Open Source Community.
- **Partner Packages**: For independent packages that are co-maintained by LangChain and a partner.

For the most part, new integrations should be added to the Community package. Partner packages require more maintenance as separate packages, so please confirm with the LangChain team before creating a new partner package.

In the following sections, we'll walk through how to contribute to each of these packages from a fake company, `Parrot Link AI`.

## Community Package

The `langchain-community` package is in `libs/community` and contains most integrations.

It is installed by users with `pip install langchain-community`, and exported members can be imported with code like 

```python
from langchain_community.chat_models import ParrotLinkLLM
from langchain_community.llms import ChatParrotLink
from langchain_community.vectorstores import ParrotLinkVectorStore
```

The community package relies on manually-installed dependent packages, so you will see errors if you try to import a package that is not installed. In our fake example, if you tried to import `ParrotLinkLLM` without installing `parrot-link-sdk`, you will see an `ImportError` telling you to install it when trying to use it.

Let's say we wanted to implement a chat model for Parrot Link AI. We would create a new file in `libs/community/langchain_community/chat_models/parrot_link.py` with the following code:

```python
from langchain_core.language_models.chat_models import BaseChatModel

class ChatParrotLink(BaseChatModel):
    """ChatParrotLink chat model.

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            from langchain_parrot_link import ChatParrotLink

            model = ChatParrotLink()
    """

    ...
```

And we would write tests in:

- Unit tests: `libs/community/tests/unit_tests/chat_models/test_parrot_link.py`
- Integration tests: `libs/community/tests/integration_tests/chat_models/test_parrot_link.py`

And add documentation to:

- `docs/docs/integrations/chat/parrot_link.ipynb`

## Partner Packages

Partner packages are in `libs/partners/*` and are installed by users with `pip install langchain-{partner}`, and exported members can be imported with code like 

```python
from langchain_{partner} import X
```

### Set up a new package

To set up a new partner package, use the latest version of the LangChain CLI. You can install or update it with:

```bash
pip install -U langchain-cli
```

Let's say you want to create a new partner package working for a company called Parrot Link AI.

Then, run the following command to create a new partner package:

```bash
cd libs/partners
langchain-cli integration new
> Name: parrot-link
> Name of integration in PascalCase [ParrotLink]: ParrotLink
```

This will create a new package in `libs/partners/parrot-link` with the following structure:

```
libs/partners/parrot-link/
  langchain_parrot_link/ # folder containing your package
    ...
  tests/
    ...
  docs/ # bootstrapped docs notebooks, must be moved to /docs in monorepo root
    ...
  scripts/ # scripts for CI
    ...
  LICENSE
  README.md # fill out with information about your package
  Makefile # default commands for CI
  pyproject.toml # package metadata, mostly managed by Poetry
  poetry.lock # package lockfile, managed by Poetry
  .gitignore
```

### Implement your package

First, add any dependencies your package needs, such as your company's SDK:

```bash
poetry add parrot-link-sdk
```

If you need separate dependencies for type checking, you can add them to the `typing` group with:

```bash
poetry add --group typing types-parrot-link-sdk
```

Then, implement your package in `libs/partners/parrot-link/langchain_parrot_link`.

By default, this will include stubs for a Chat Model, an LLM, and/or a Vector Store. You should delete any of the files you won't use and remove them from `__init__.py`.

### Write Unit and Integration Tests

Some basic tests are generated in the tests/ directory. You should add more tests to cover your package's functionality.

For information on running and implementing tests, see the [Testing guide](./testing).

### Write documentation

Documentation is generated from Jupyter notebooks in the `docs/` directory. You should move the generated notebooks to the relevant `docs/docs/integrations` directory in the monorepo root.

### Additional steps

Contributor steps:

- [ ] Add secret names to manual integrations workflow in `.github/workflows/_integration_test.yml`
- [ ] Add secrets to release workflow (for pre-release testing) in `.github/workflows/_release.yml`

Maintainer steps (Contributors should **not** do these):

- [ ] set up pypi and test pypi projects
- [ ] add credential secrets to Github Actions
- [ ] add package to conda-forge
