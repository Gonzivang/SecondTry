# Milvus

>[Milvus](https://milvus.io/docs/overview.md) is a database that stores, indexes, and manages
> massive embedding vectors generated by deep neural networks and other machine learning (ML) models.


## Installation and Setup

Install the Python SDK:

```bash
pip install pymilvus
```

## Vector Store

There exists a wrapper around `Milvus` indexes, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:
```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Milvus
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of the `Miluvs` wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/milvus)
