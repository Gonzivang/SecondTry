# pii-protected-chatbot

This template creates a chatbot that flags any incoming PII and doesn't pass it to the LLM.

## Environment Setup

The following environment variables need to be set:

Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to access the OpenAI models.

## Usage

To use this package, you should first have the LangChain CLI installed:

```shell
pip install -U "langchain-cli[serve]"
```

To create a new LangChain project and install this as the only package, you can do:

```shell
langchain app new my-app --package pii-protected-chatbot
```

If you want to add this to an existing project, you can just run:

```shell
langchain app add pii-protected-chatbot
```

And add the following code to your `server.py` file:
```python
from pii_protected_chatbot.chain import chain as pii_protected_chatbot

add_routes(app, pii_protected_chatbot, path="/openai-functions-agent")
```

(Optional) Let's now configure LangSmith. 
LangSmith will help us trace, monitor and debug LangChain applications. 
LangSmith is currently in private beta, you can sign up [here](https://smith.langchain.com/). 
If you don't have access, you can skip this section

```shell
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=<your-project>  # if not specified, defaults to "default"
```

If you are inside this directory, then you can spin up a LangServe instance directly by:

```shell
langchain serve
```

This will start the FastAPI app with a server is running locally at 
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
