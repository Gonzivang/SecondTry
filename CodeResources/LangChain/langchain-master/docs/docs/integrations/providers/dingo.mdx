# DingoDB

This page covers how to use the DingoDB ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific DingoDB wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- Install the Python SDK with `pip install dingodb`

## VectorStore

There exists a wrapper around DingoDB indexes, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:
```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Dingo
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of the DingoDB wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/dingo)
