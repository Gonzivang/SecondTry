### Azure OpenAI

>[Microsoft Azure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure), often referred to as `Azure` is a cloud computing platform run by `Microsoft`, which offers access, management, and development of applications and services through global data centers. It provides a range of capabilities, including software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). `Microsoft Azure` supports many programming languages, tools, and frameworks, including Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems.

>[Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/) is an `Azure` service with powerful language models from `OpenAI` including the `GPT-3`, `Codex` and `Embeddings model` series for content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation.

```bash
pip install langchain-openai
```

Set the environment variables to get access to the `Azure OpenAI` service.

```python
import os

os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] = "https://<your-endpoint.openai.azure.com/"
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your AzureOpenAI key"

### Azure Blob Storage

>[Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction) is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob Storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.

>[Azure Files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction) offers fully managed
> file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block (`SMB`) protocol,
> Network File System (`NFS`) protocol, and `Azure Files REST API`. `Azure Files` are based on the `Azure Blob Storage`.

`Azure Blob Storage` is designed for:
- Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
- Storing files for distributed access.
- Streaming video and audio.
- Writing to log files.
- Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
- Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.

```bash
pip install azure-storage-blob
```

See a [usage example for the Azure Blob Storage](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/azure_blob_storage_container).

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import AzureBlobStorageContainerLoader
```

See a [usage example for the Azure Files](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/azure_blob_storage_file).

> It features calculation or computation capabilities, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming 
> language called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Excel forms part of the Microsoft 365 suite of software.

The `UnstructuredExcelLoader` is used to load `Microsoft Excel` files. The loader works with both `.xlsx` and `.xls` files. 
The page content will be the raw text of the Excel file. If you use the loader in `"elements"` mode, an HTML 
representation of the Excel file will be available in the document metadata under the `text_as_html` key.
