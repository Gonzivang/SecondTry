FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------

When you use tools or generate final answer, please output a response in one of two formats:
**Option 1: Explain and Use plugin**
If the response involves using a plugin, you can start with a natural language explanation[Optional], plus exactly one plugin calling[MUST], and ends with no more words. The plugin calling format should be a markdown code snippet with the following JSON schema:

```json
{{{{
    "action": string wrapped with \"\", // The action to take. Must be one in the list [{tool_names}]
    "action_input": string wrapped with \"\" // Query to be input to the action plugin. Pass as much information as possible to the plugin from the history of the conversation.
}}}}
```
NEVER EVER EVER make up a plugin not in [{tool_names}]
You MUST pass as much information as possible to the plugin from the history of the conversation. It could be natural language or structured language like jsonl, csv, etc. BUT MUST in a single line.
(Please note that ONLY ONE plugin should be used per response.)

**Option #2: **
If you want to respond directly to the human without using a plugin, provide a plain natural language response. However, if you initially generated a natural language response and then decide to use a plugin, make sure to include the plugin action and input after the initial response.

THOUGHT
--------------------

Okay, So what's next? Are the plugins' response enough to answer human's initial query? Please follow these instructions:

1. Evaluate plugin Response [Mandatory]: Carefully evaluate the plugin's response and determine if it sufficiently addresses the human's query. Consider the content and implications of the plugin's response.

2. Consider Additional plugin Use [Optional 2 or 3]: If the plugin response does not fully address the query or if an error occurred during execution, you may proceed with additional plugin usage. However, exercise caution and limit the number of iterations to a maximum of 5. You can start with a natural language explanation[Optional], plus exactly one plugin calling[MUST]. Follow this format for additional plugin usage:

```json
{{{{
    "action": string wrapped with \"\", // The action to take. Must be one of [{tool_names}]
    "action_input": string wrapped with \"\" // Query to be input to the action plugin. Pass as much information as possible to the plugin from the history of the conversation.
}}}}
```
(Please note that ONLY ONE plugin should be used per response.)

3. Deliver Comprehensive Answer [Optional 2 or 3]: If the plugin response sufficiently addresses the query, deliver a comprehensive answer to the human. Focus solely on the content and implications of the plugin's response. MUST NOT include explanations of the plugin's functions.

Note. you must do 1; For 2 and 3, You must choose one from them.
