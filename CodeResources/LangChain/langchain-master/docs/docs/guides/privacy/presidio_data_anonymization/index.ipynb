    "# Data anonymization with Microsoft Presidio\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/docs/docs/guides/privacy/presidio_data_anonymization/index.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    ">[Presidio](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/) (Origin from Latin praesidium ‘protection, garrison’) helps to ensure sensitive data is properly managed and governed. It provides fast identification and anonymization modules for private entities in text and images such as credit card numbers, names, locations, social security numbers, bitcoin wallets, US phone numbers, financial data and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use case\n",
    "\n",
    "Data anonymization is crucial before passing information to a language model like GPT-4 because it helps protect privacy and maintain confidentiality. If data is not anonymized, sensitive information such as names, addresses, contact numbers, or other identifiers linked to specific individuals could potentially be learned and misused. Hence, by obscuring or removing this personally identifiable information (PII), data can be used freely without compromising individuals' privacy rights or breaching data protection laws and regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Anonynization consists of two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identification:** Identify all data fields that contain personally identifiable information (PII).\n",
    "2. **Replacement**: Replace all PIIs with pseudo values or codes that do not reveal any personal information about the individual but can be used for reference. We're not using regular encryption, because the language model won't be able to understand the meaning or context of the encrypted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use *Microsoft Presidio* together with *Faker* framework for anonymization purposes because of the wide range of functionalities they provide. The full implementation is available in `PresidioAnonymizer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will find the use case on how to leverage anonymization in LangChain."
