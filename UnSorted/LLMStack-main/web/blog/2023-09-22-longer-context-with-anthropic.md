If you have built content generation apps like blog post generators or any other app that generates or processes text, you know that the biggest challenge is handling large amounts of text. The current state of the art models are limited by the context windows making it hard to generate or handle large text. Anthropic's launch of [Claude-2](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2), a 100K context window language model, changes that. At Promptly, we are excited to announce that you can now build apps that leverage Claude-2 via our [LLMStack](https://llmstack.ai) framework and [Promptly](https://trypromptly.com) platform.
