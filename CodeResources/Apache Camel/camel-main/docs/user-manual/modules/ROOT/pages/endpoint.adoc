= Endpoints

Camel supports the xref:components:eips:message-endpoint.adoc[Message Endpoint] pattern
using the https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html[Endpoint]
interface.

Endpoints are created by a xref:component.adoc[Component] and these endpoints are referred
to in the xref:dsl.adoc[DSL] via their endpoint xref:uris.adoc[URIs].

== Example

The following example route demonstrates the use of a xref:components::file-component.adoc[File]
consumer endpoint and a * xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS] producer endpoint,
by their xref:manual::uris.adoc[URIs]:

[source,java]
----
from("file:messages/foo")
    .to("jms:queue:foo");
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="file:messages/foo"/>
    <to uri="jms:queue:foo"/>
</route>
----

== Endpoint API

You will almost never have the need for creating endpoints manually via Java API.

From an `Endpoint` you can use the following Java API methods to create producers or consumers to the endpoint:

* https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createProducer--[`createProducer()`]
will create a
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Producer.html[Producer]
for sending message exchanges to the endpoint.

* https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createConsumer-org.apache.camel.Processor[`createConsumer()`]
implements the xref:components:eips:eventDrivenConsumer-eip.adoc[Event Driven Consumer]
pattern for consuming message exchanges from the endpoint via a
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Processor.html[Processor]
when creating a
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Consumer.html[Consumer].

* https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createPollingConsumer[`createPollingConsumer()`]
implements the xref:components:eips:polling-consumer.adoc[Polling Consumer] pattern for
consuming message exchanges from the endpoint via a
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/PollingConsumer.html[PollingConsumer].
