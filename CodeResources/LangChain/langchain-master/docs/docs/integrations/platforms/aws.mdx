# AWS

The `LangChain` integrations related to [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) platform.

## LLMs

### Bedrock

>[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a fully managed service that offers a choice of 
> high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like `AI21 Labs`, `Anthropic`, `Cohere`, 
> `Meta`, `Stability AI`, and `Amazon` via a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to 
> build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using `Amazon Bedrock`, 
> you can easily experiment with and evaluate top FMs for your use case, privately customize them with 
> your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and `Retrieval Augmented Generation` (`RAG`), and build 
> agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources. Since `Amazon Bedrock` is 
> serverless, you don't have to manage any infrastructure, and you can securely integrate and deploy 
> generative AI capabilities into your applications using the AWS services you are already familiar with.

 
See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/llms/bedrock).

```python
from langchain_community.llms.bedrock import Bedrock
```

### Amazon API Gateway

>[Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) is a fully managed service that makes it easy for 
> developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" 
> for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using 
> `API Gateway`, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication 
> applications. `API Gateway` supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.
> 
> `API Gateway` handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of 
> concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, 
> throttling, monitoring, and API version management. `API Gateway` has no minimum fees or startup costs. 
> You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out and, with the `API Gateway` 
> tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API usage scales.

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/llms/amazon_api_gateway).

```python
from langchain_community.llms import AmazonAPIGateway
