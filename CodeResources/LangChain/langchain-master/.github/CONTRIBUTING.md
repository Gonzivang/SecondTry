# Contributing to LangChain

Hi there! Thank you for even being interested in contributing to LangChain.
As an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions, whether they involve new features, improved infrastructure, better documentation, or bug fixes.

To learn about how to contribute, please follow the [guides here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/contributing/)

## üó∫Ô∏è Guidelines

### üë©‚Äçüíª Ways to contribute

There are many ways to contribute to LangChain. Here are some common ways people contribute:

- [**Documentation**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/contributing/documentation): Help improve our docs, including this one!
- [**Code**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/contributing/code): Help us write code, fix bugs, or improve our infrastructure.
- [**Integrations**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/contributing/integration): Help us integrate with your favorite vendors and tools.

### üö©GitHub Issues

Our [issues](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues) page is kept up to date with bugs, improvements, and feature requests.

There is a taxonomy of labels to help with sorting and discovery of issues of interest. Please use these to help organize issues.

If you start working on an issue, please assign it to yourself.

If you are adding an issue, please try to keep it focused on a single, modular bug/improvement/feature.
If two issues are related, or blocking, please link them rather than combining them.

We will try to keep these issues as up-to-date as possible, though
with the rapid rate of development in this field some may get out of date.
If you notice this happening, please let us know.

### üôãGetting Help

Our goal is to have the simplest developer setup possible. Should you experience any difficulty getting setup, please
contact a maintainer! Not only do we want to help get you unblocked, but we also want to make sure that the process is
smooth for future contributors.

In a similar vein, we do enforce certain linting, formatting, and documentation standards in the codebase.
If you are finding these difficult (or even just annoying) to work with, feel free to contact a maintainer for help -
we do not want these to get in the way of getting good code into the codebase.
