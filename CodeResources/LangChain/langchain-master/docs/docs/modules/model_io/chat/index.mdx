# Chat Models

ChatModels are a core component of LangChain.
LangChain does not serve its own ChatModels, but rather provides a standard interface for interacting with many different models. To be specific, this interface is one that takes as input a list of messages and returns a message.


There are lots of model providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - the `ChatModel` class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them.
