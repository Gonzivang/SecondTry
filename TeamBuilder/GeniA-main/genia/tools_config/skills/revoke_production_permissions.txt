To revoke temporary production permissions from a user, follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the user's AWS IAM Username.
2. Set the AWS IAM Group Name as 'production-shift-group'.
3. Call the 'remove_user_from_group' function with the group name 'production-shift-group' and the 'on-call' user's username as arguments.
4. Verify the response from the function call to ensure that the user was successfully added to the group.
5. Print a success message to the user indicating that the 'on-call' user has been revoked temporary permissions for production.
