# sql-llama2

This template enables a user to interact with a SQL database using natural language. 

It uses LLamA2-13b hosted by [Replicate](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/replicate), but can be adapted to any API that supports LLaMA2 including [Fireworks](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/fireworks). 

The template includes an example database of 2023 NBA rosters. 

For more information on how to build this database, see [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes/blob/main/demo_apps/StructuredLlama.ipynb).

## Environment Setup

Ensure the `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` is set in your environment.

## Usage

To use this package, you should first have the LangChain CLI installed:

```shell
pip install -U langchain-cli
```

To create a new LangChain project and install this as the only package, you can do:

```shell
langchain app new my-app --package sql-llama2
```

If you want to add this to an existing project, you can just run:

```shell
langchain app add sql-llama2
```

And add the following code to your `server.py` file:
```python
from sql_llama2 import chain as sql_llama2_chain

add_routes(app, sql_llama2_chain, path="/sql-llama2")
```

(Optional) Let's now configure LangSmith. 
LangSmith will help us trace, monitor and debug LangChain applications. 
LangSmith is currently in private beta, you can sign up [here](https://smith.langchain.com/). 
If you don't have access, you can skip this section


```shell
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=<your-project>  # if not specified, defaults to "default"
```

If you are inside this directory, then you can spin up a LangServe instance directly by:

```shell
langchain serve
```

This will start the FastAPI app with a server is running locally at 
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

We can see all templates at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
We can access the playground at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/sql-llama2/playground](http://127.0.0.1:8000/sql-llama2/playground)  

We can access the template from code with:

```python
from langserve.client import RemoteRunnable

runnable = RemoteRunnable("http://localhost:8000/sql-llama2")
```
