        Please add a self-contained, [minimal, reproducible, example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) with your use case.
        
        If a maintainer can copy it, run it, and see it right away, there's a much higher chance that you'll be able to get help.
        
        If you're including an error message, please include the full stack trace not just the last error.
        
        **Important!** Use code tags to correctly format your code. See https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting
        Avoid screenshots when possible, as they are hard to read and (more importantly) don't allow others to copy-and-paste your code.

        The following code: 
        
        ```python
        from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda

        def bad_code(inputs) -> int:
          raise NotImplementedError('For demo purpose')
          
          chain = RunnableLambda(bad_code)
          chain.invoke('Hello!')
        ```
        
        Include both the error and the full stack trace if reporting an exception!
