# ModelScope

>[ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/home) is a big repository of the models and datasets.

This page covers how to use the modelscope ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific modelscope wrappers.

## Installation and Setup

Install the `modelscope` package.
 
```bash
pip install modelscope
```


## Text Embedding Models


```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import ModelScopeEmbeddings
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of this, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/modelscope_hub)
